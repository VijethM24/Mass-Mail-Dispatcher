# Mass-Mail-Dispatcher
The Mass Mail Dispatcher is a web based application where it sorts between valid and invalid mails from a CSV file and sends the bulk email messages to the large number of valid recipients simultaneously.

The Mass Mail Dispatcher is a web-based application that allows users to send bulk emails with ease. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages the EmailJS API to handle email dispatching without requiring a server backend. Users can upload a CSV file with multiple email addresses. The application validates email addresses using JavaScript pattern matching to ensure only valid emails are processed. After integrating your EmailJS API key and user credentials, the tool efficiently sends mass emails to all valid recipients.
